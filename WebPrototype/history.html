                        <p>During the time when Sukhothai was the capital of Thailand(known then as Siam) many wars took place with neighboring countries. Because of primitive war strategies these battles often occurred at close quarters. This forced soldiers to become skilled at hand-to-hand combat. Since their hands were occupied with weapons the push kick and the round kick became an important part of a soldier’s arsenal. After knocking an enemy off balance with one of these methods the solider would then follow up with a weapon attack.</p>

                        <p>Between 1350-1767 not much had changed in the way of teaching and practicing Muaythai. The art was still taught on temple grounds and in local villages throughout Thailand. Also, Muaythai bouts were still held at Royal ceremonies and at this time some monetary reward was given to the fighters. Although, there were no fees to witness these spectacles and gambling had not yet been introduced to the sport. During this time, fighters who competed against each other would agree to a set of rules before the fight; a universal rule set – like we see in the sport today – was nonexistent. However, some of these traditions still carried over into modern times. For example, often you will see fighters being matched up according to body type rather than exact weight. This has been a practice since the inception of Muaythai and still lives on today.</p>

                        <p>After Burma took Ayudhaya, the king of Thailand gathered as many Thai fighters as he could to protect the country and the Royal Family from future invasions. Training in the art of Muaythai continued as it had done in the past, but the landscape of Muaythai was now changing. Because battles were being fought differently, Muaythai was used less frequently in combat. Instead, Muaythai was now growing as an activity performed in temple celebrations and during new year festivals. This was also the time when Muaythai had become more structured. Rounds were introduced, a ring began to take shape as makeshift ropes were laid out to form a square, and fighters started wrapping their hands for protection. However, there were issues with the methods of keeping time of the rounds. Coconut shells with holes in the centers were placed in water and when they sank, the round was up. Therefore, the length of each round differed. Furthermore, there were no set number of rounds; fighters simply fought until one decided to quit.</p>

                        <p>Since the early years of the Ratanakosin era not much had changed in the way of Muaythai. A formal set of rules had yet to be established and fights continued to take place in village temples and at Royal events. However, in the mid-to-late 1900s, Muaythai finally got the boost it needed to become the National Sport of Thailand. By this time rules and regulations were set into place, weight classes were formed, and boxers were given the appropriate protective equipment. Additionally, in 1955 the first televised Muaythai fight was broadcast from Rajadamnern Stadium. Because of the success of Muaythai as a sport, there became a demand for Thai boxers to test their skills against practitioners from other arts. With this, in 1959 many fights took place in which fighters from different backgrounds competed against Muaythai fighters. And with the kicks of Muaythai fighters proving to be too much for most other martial artists, Thai boxers usually came out as the winners of these contests.</p>
